# And for rapid development, we have a watch set up that checks to see if
# any of the files listed below change, and then to execute the listed
# tasks when they do. This just saves us from having to type "grunt" into
# the command-line every time we want to see what we're working on; we can
# instead just leave "grunt watch" running in a background terminal. Set it
# and forget it, as Ron Popeil used to tell us.
#
# But we don't need the same thing to happen for all the files.
